## Overview

React Shopping List is a user-friendly shopping list application built with React and Express. Users can add, delete, and mark items as purchased, ensuring a smooth and organized shopping experience.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Easily add new items to your shopping list, specifying their name, quantity, and unit.

- **Mark as Purchased**: Keep track of your shopping by marking items as purchased once they're in your cart.

- **Delete Items**: Remove any items you no longer need from your shopping list.

- **Reset List**: Reset the purchase status of all items in the list with a single click.

- **Clear List**: Start fresh by clearing all items from the shopping list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kennyfergy/Group-FS-react-shopping-list.git
    ```
2. Create a database named `shopping_list`,
3. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install required packages,
5. Run `npm run server` to start the server,
6. In another terminal, run `npm run client` to start the React application. This will automatically open a new browser tab pointing to the client.
